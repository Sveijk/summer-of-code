## Sharing your knowledge

Asked by [MirrorConf](https://www.mirrorconf.com/) and Rails Girls Summer of Code to attend and speak on the conference in Braga. We were excited and full of ideas: our talk would be about beginning devs and what hurdles they can encounter. To begin with, the organisation team did an excellent job in taking care of their speakers and because of this there was a very welcoming atmosphere. We felt very welcome! Our talk was due on the first day of the conference, among other great topics.

To kickoff our talk, and out of curiosity, I asked the audience how many of them had just started programming about a year ago, some 30 hands were raised. Then I asked them who wasn't programming at all and another 50/60 hands were raised. So I concluded: "Awesome, I then assume all others are mid-level / senior developers, this talk will be for you!". Total attendees must have been around 250/300 not sure.

## We felt a bit like imposters even..

In this Summer of Code project we were lucky to have good coaches and a supportive mentor and supervisor, we voiced that everyone can be a good mentor for a beginning developer. It's not only mentoring in a traditional way that's important. Among other things, if you don't like to teach itâ€™s still good mentoring to write extensive documentation. Or to answer questions on reddit and stack overflow. There are so many ways in which you can contribute meaningfully to the growth of your junior, and for that matter of your team members. Another example is to write comments on Pull Requests you get.

## A potato for every occasion

We learned during the program that there's so much more to coding, than programming itself. That basic feeling of not knowing enough to do the job is something we will encounter in life on many different ways. But with coding, it's a day to day business, the confrontation with not knowing. As humans, most of the time we have an option to choose: go bungee jumping for the first time or not. This seems to be the overarching theme of coding, too. There is so much to learn, that every coding challenge is another decision of whether to jump. You never know what you're going to get. So if you're prepared to take a challenge, you'll grow on the fly, and code through it. It will never be the same thing twice, and definitely won't be as you expected, but it will feel adventurous. I guess what we want to say is that we can choose if we want to live the fear or not. Feeling adventurous ? become developer : choose another profession.

We both had part time jobs when we started Rails Girls. Alina was a growth-hacking trainer, and Sabine was (and still is) a front-end developer at her company. We've had to make sacrifices to find time for everything, but we both knew the best way for us to continue our growth as developers was to learn by doing. Actually working on a project for an intense period and lots of hours has caused us to grow exponentially. This is exactly what we wanted and needed when starting a different career path. Working on our project has consolidated a lot of our progress and gave us more confidence in developing and knowing that we can learn if we persevere. We were so humbled to get a chance to do that with Stretchly and Rails Girls.

## Talk to each other

Part of our way of overcoming our fears and anxieties was to talk to each other. As a team we are very open about issues we encounter in the project or in our personal lives. So, whenever we were stressed about an issue we discussed it first thing. It helped us to reconsider or get other viewpoints to a code problem or situation. Having mentors, coaches, teammates to rely on has provided us with an environment where we felt comfortable and safe.

Even so, the list of hurdles we encounter as junior developers grows bigger every day. To name a few, this is what we've come across:

- Not enough documentation written for our innocent junior dev eyes (it takes hours to sometimes decipher documentation)
- Working with timezones in any code is a huge pain! Just ask Jan (our mentor), Dan (our coach), or Jack (our coach) and they will confirm
- Interview question: What is a DNS? [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) Go figure!
- Junior software-engineer job listing: minimum 3 years of experience
- Corrupting git branch data to a point of no return (queue Phantom of the Opera soundtrack in the background)

Just like we've found solutions to most of these, we're determined to chip at this list one issue at a time, and bungee jump as much as it takes :)

Overall, we had a great smooth time at Rails Girls, with very few hiccups along the way because we were lucky to have our amazing supervisors and mentors. Going forward, I think we'll find that having a network to rely on will be one of the most effective ways to overcome these struggles. We can only hope that one day we'll be at a level where we can provide the same type of support for future aspiring devs!
